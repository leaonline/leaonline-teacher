## Install and run

We use Meteor for our application to fetch and display data in near realtime.
To install Meteor run the install script:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Please note, that Windows is supported by Meteor but not officially supported by this repo.
If you get everything running on Windows (dev, tests, build / deployment) feel free to update
the documentation accordingly for Windows users.

### Install accounts server

The lea.online system (which this app is part of) uses a [dedicated OAuth2 server](https://github.com/leaonline/leaonline-accounts)
for authenticating users and authorizing access across applications. If you have not installed this repo from the main
[development repository](https://github.com/leaonline/dev) (recommended), you need to install the accounts server
manually:

```bash
https://github.com/leaonline/leaonline-accounts
cd ./leaonline-accounts
./run.sh
```

### Install teacher app

For the teacher app you need to clone this repo and run the `./run.sh` script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leaonline/leaonline-teacher.git
cd ./leaonline-teacher
./run.sh
```

Finally, open your browser at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) to load the client app.
You can login with one of the [initially created accounts](https://github.com/leaonline/leaonline-accounts/#initial-accounts-in-development) to continue to the teacher dashboard.

## Development and contribution to this project

Every contribution is appreciated and we treat every issue and pull request with care.
Please note, that we follow a certain workflow for contributions.

### Contribution workflow

1. **Create issue**

   There should always be an issue, describing a bug or a feature request before contributing code.
   Pull requests without issues **will be on hold** until an issue is created and passed step 2.
   Issues that did not go through step 2 will get the `needs approval` label.

2. **Issue approved / rejected**

   The core team will discuss the issue and approves or rejects it. Approved issues get the `pr welcome` label assigned
   and will also contain a comment of approval / denial to inform all issue members.

3. **Open pull request**

   You should always create a pull request to the `develop` branch, unless there is a strong reason to merge
   into another specific branch. Note that `master` is disabled for non-core members.

   It is possible to reference multiple issues with a single PR as long as it's made clear, which issues
   are solved by which parts of the PR. Try to avoid to solve multiple issues with a single commit.

   Pull requests that have merge conflicts, failed the linter, failed the tests or miss tests for new features / bigger
   changes will not get into review phase. They will also be tagged with the `fixes required` label.

   Work-in-progress pull requests are encouraged and you should tag them with the `work in progress` label
   to show others that this PR is still incomplete.

4. **Review**

   There will be always reviewes for a PR from externals.
   Reviews should reject the pull request, in case of any changes required. However, there may the case of
   neglectable changes ("nice to have"), which may not affect the approval of the pull request.
   In such a case, an issue should be opened and referenced in the comment, while the pull request can be approved.

5. **Merge**

   The PR is merged into the `develop` branch and the issue is closed. The core team will usually
   increase the version of the project in a separate commit.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure follows the
[recommended structure from the Meteor guide](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#javascript-structure).
If you are not familiar with it, please consult the Meteor guide, first.

#### Updating and documenting the folder structure

In order to build / update the folder structure please edit the respective `README.md` file in the folder
you want to describe. The description is wrapped inside comments to indicate that this part is printed to the tree.

Example:

```markdown
# foldername

This will not be printed but still be part of the README.

<!-- optional markdown-notes-tree directory description starts here -->

This will be printed as description next to the folder name

<!-- optional markdown-notes-tree directory description ends here -->

This will not be printed but still be part of the README.
```

And run the respective build script `npm run build:folder-tree`. After that, please validate the markdown using
the `lint:markdown` script.

### UI Components

~~We use [Meteor Blaze Bootstrap](https://github.com/jankapunkt/meteor-blaze-bs4) as UI components library.
Please read it's documentation, if you are interested to contribute to the UI part.~~

Note: we will migrate to Bootstrap 5 soon so consider to use plain HTML components with Boostrap classes.

### Styleguide

This project uses several style rules, enforced by different linters. The following table shows the styles and their
respective tools and commands (scripts, see [package.json](./package.json)):

|Category|Style|Tool|NPM Script|
|--------|-----|----|-------|
|JS|[Javascript standard style](https://standardjs.com/)|`standard`|`lint:code`|
|SCSS|[Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/)|`stylelint`|`lint:style`|
|Markdown|[Markdown lint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)|`markdownlint`|`lint:markdown`|

Make sure to run all linters without error, before you open a pull request.  There is a `lint.sh` shellscript added
for your convenience. It basically executes these commands in a row.

### Testing guide

This project uses `mocha` and `chai` for tests. In order to run the tests locally in watch mode, you simply
need to call the `test.sh` script and then watch your `server` tests on the console and your `client` tests on
`localhost:5566` in the browser.

You can call the script with the following options:

- `-v` - verbose, prints variables and paths before the test execution
- `-c` - cli, also used in the ci workflow, runs the script ones in headless mode using `puppeteer`

## CI guide

The ci workflows run on push to `master` and `develop` (which is restricted) and on pull requests.
Every ci workflow includes the following jobs:

- lint code
- lint style
- lint markdown
- pass tests

If any of these jobs failes, the whole workflow fails and your PR is not considered for review until the issues
have been resolved.

## Deployment

We use [`mup` (Meteor-Up)](http://meteor-up.com/) as one-step deployment tool.
While deployment to the official lea.online platform is restricted to the lea core developers,
you still might want to deploy a custom build. In this case you should follow the documentation
on their website. It's super easy.
